# Book-Recommender-System

**Collaborative Filtering Book Recommendation System**

Implemented a collaborative filtering recommendation system using k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) to identify user clusters based on common book ratings. Leveraged the top k-nearest neighbor average ratings to predict user preferences and provide personalized book recommendations.

**Key Tasks:**
- Collaborative filtering with k-NN: Utilized common book ratings to identify user clusters, fostering a collaborative approach to recommendation.
- Popularity-based filtering: Combined rating data with total rating counts to discern popular books while excluding less popular ones, enhancing the relevance of recommendations.
- User-centric functions: Developed Python functions for personalized recommendations, including a function to display the top-10 recommended books for a given user.
- Probable rating prediction: Implemented a function that takes a user ID and ISBN as input to predict the probable rating of a book by that user.

This project showcased proficiency in collaborative filtering techniques, data manipulation, and algorithm implementation in Python, highlighting skills in recommendation systems and data-driven decision-making.
